# specd

A specification-driven development CLI tool.

## Tech Stack

- **Language:** Go (no CGO — `CGO_ENABLED=0` always)
- **CLI framework:** [Cobra](https://cobra.dev/)
- **Task runner:** [Taskfile](https://taskfile.dev/) (`task` command)
- **Live reload:** [Air](https://github.com/air-verse/air)
- **Git hooks:** [Lefthook](https://github.com/evilmartians/lefthook) (parallel execution)
- **Linting:** [golangci-lint](https://golangci-lint.run/) (meta-linter, see `.golangci.yml`)
- **Formatting:** gofumpt + goimports + gci (auto-fix, never warn)
- **Security:** gosec (static), govulncheck (deps), gitleaks (secrets)
- **Commit linting:** [conform](https://github.com/siderolabs/conform) (conventional commits)
- **Frontend:** Custom CSS framework + HTML (planned, not yet implemented)
- You must write idiomatic Go.
- You must use 2 spaces as indentation for Non-Go code file

```

## Git Hooks (via lefthook)

- **pre-commit** (parallel): format (gofumpt + goimports + gci), golangci-lint --fix, gitleaks
- **commit-msg:** conform (conventional commit format required)
- **pre-push** (parallel): tests, govulncheck

Run `task hooks:install` after cloning.

## Commit Message Format

Conventional commits enforced by conform:

```
type(scope): description    # scope is optional
```

Types: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `style`, `refactor`, `perf`, `test`, `build`, `ci`, `chore`, `revert`

## Pushing Code

All commits must pass three hook stages before reaching the remote:

1. **pre-commit**: formatters, golangci-lint, gitleaks
2. **commit-msg**: conventional commit format (conform)
3. **pre-push**: `go test ./...`, `govulncheck ./...`

Additionally, all commits must be:
- **DCO signed off** (`Signed-off-by` line) — use `git commit -s` or set `git config format.signoff true`
- **Cryptographically signed** (SSH or GPG) — enforced by branch protection on `main`

If a push is rejected, fix the issue, amend or create a new commit, and push again. Do not use `--no-verify` to bypass hooks.

## Rules

- **Never trust training data for external tool conventions, APIs, or directory structures.** Always search the web and read primary sources (official docs, actual repos) first. This is especially critical when the user explicitly asks you to search. Do not guess or rely on what you "know" — verify it.
- **No CGO.** All builds use `CGO_ENABLED=0`. Never add C dependencies.
- **Cross-compilation** targets: linux, darwin, windows × amd64, arm64. All built from macOS.
- **Cobra commands** go in `cmd/`. One file per command. Follow Cobra conventions.
- **All exported functions** must have a doc comment.
- **Unused function parameters** must be named `_`.
- **Always run `task lint` after writing or modifying Go code.** Do not declare work done until it passes with 0 issues. The pre-commit hook will block the commit otherwise.
- **Never finish a task without writing tests for all new or changed code.** If you added a function, command, or behavior, write tests for it before declaring done. Check for coverage gaps proactively — do not wait to be asked.
- **Test resources must include negative cases.** When creating test data for search, linking, or matching, always include items from unrelated domains that should NOT match. Testing only positive cases proves nothing.
- **Do not start the dev server** — the user runs it themselves.
- **Do not add features, fallbacks, or logic beyond what was asked.** If the user says "use X as a fallback", only add X — do not invent additional fallbacks (e.g. OS username) on your own.
- **Never duplicate logic across functions.** If three functions share 80%+ of their code, extract the common logic into a single parameterized function. Use maps or config structs to handle per-case differences (e.g. `bm25Queries` map for per-kind SQL).
- **Never silently swallow errors.** SQL query errors, scan errors, and file I/O errors must be returned — not ignored with `if err == nil {` or `continue`. Silent failures hide bugs.
- **Never pass user input raw to FTS5 MATCH.** Always sanitize through `sanitizeBM25` or `sanitizeTrigram`. Never pass through FTS5 operators (AND, OR, NOT, NEAR) from user input — this is an injection vector.
- **Frontend work** (custom CSS framework, HTML, templates) comes later. Don't scaffold it yet.

## Skills

- specd uses the **[Agent Skills Standard](https://agentskills.io/specification)** for all AI provider integrations.
- All three providers (Claude, OpenAI Codex, Gemini) support the same `<name>/SKILL.md` format. **Do NOT use legacy formats** (`.claude/commands/`, `.gemini/commands/*.toml`). Always use `<provider-dir>/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`.
- Canonical skills live in `skills/` at the repo root and are embedded into the binary via `go:embed`.
- Provider skill directories:
  - Claude: `.claude/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`
  - Codex: `.agents/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`
  - Gemini: `.gemini/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`
- **Always verify conventions against primary sources** before implementing. Do not rely on stale knowledge. Check the actual repos and official docs:
  - Agent Skills Standard: https://agentskills.io/specification
  - Claude Code: https://code.claude.com/docs/en/skills
  - Codex CLI: https://developers.openai.com/codex/skills
  - Gemini CLI: https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli/blob/main/docs/cli/creating-skills.md

## Search

- **Hybrid BM25 + trigram** strategy in `cmd/search.go`. Single `Search()` entry point, single `searchByKind()` implementation for all three kinds — no copy-pasted per-kind functions.
- **BM25** (primary): FTS5 with porter stemming. Tokens are individually quoted via `sanitizeBM25`. Results ranked by score (higher = better).
- **Trigram** (fallback): FTS5 trigram tokenizer for substring matching. Activated when BM25 returns < 3 hits or query has special characters. Trigram results have score=0, appended after BM25 results.
- **Deduplication**: `seen` map prevents the same ID appearing in both BM25 and trigram results. `excludeID` filters out the document being searched for.
- Per-kind SQL lives in the `bm25Queries` map — add new searchable kinds there, not by duplicating functions.
- `NewSpecResponse` JSON field for KB results is `related_kb_chunks` — do not rename this, deployed skills depend on it.

## Slugs

- **Two slug formats** — do not mix them:
  - `ToSlug()` → underscore-separated (e.g. `pending_verification`). Used for config values: spec types, task stages. These are stored in `.specd.json` and used in SQL CHECK constraints.
  - `ToDashSlug()` → dash-separated (e.g. `user-authentication`). Used for content identifiers: spec slugs, task slugs, KB slugs. These appear in filenames and URLs.
- **Never use `ToSlug()` for content identifiers** — always use `ToDashSlug()`.

## Project Guard

- Most commands require an initialized project (`.specd.json` marker in cwd) and a globally configured username (`~/.specd/config.json`).
- Exempt commands that work without initialization: `init`, `version`, `skills`, `help`.

## Skills Prerequisite

- **Every skill** must include a prerequisite section telling the AI to check for `.specd.json` and ask the user to run `specd init` in their terminal if missing. Skills must NOT run init themselves. The message must say exactly "Please run `specd init` in your terminal first" — do NOT suggest shell prefixes, prompt shortcuts (`!`), or any alternative execution method.
- Runtime-configurable values (e.g. `top_search_results`) must be read from `.specd.json` at runtime, not from build-time constants. Constants are only used as defaults during `specd init`.
